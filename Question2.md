# Normalize the data

To answer this question I would like to sugest that we could create a normilized table (from occurrence.onca.csv) with information about the location of the occurrences (countries and states) and the year of the occurrence.
With this information we could obtain an indication of the predominant area of habitat, and we can identfy if the animal is changing the area of habitat over the years.
